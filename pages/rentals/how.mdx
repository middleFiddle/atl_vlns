### Monthly subscription

- No minimum contract.
- No cap on how long you can build equity with our rental program.
  &nbsp;

### A <small>small</small> portion of the payment every month covers maintenance and repairs

- Significantly less than what you can expect to pay to maintain an actively used instrument.
- Covers replacing spoiled ('false') or broken strings, providing a fresh bow when it is time to rehair, minor cosmetic wear, and expected repairs.
  &nbsp;

### The remainder is held as equity towards a purchase

- 100% of your payment after maintenance and tax
- Again, there is no cap on how much equity you can build
- For each instrument, there is a flat mininum purchase price set at an entry level threshold for an instrument worth maintaining.
- You are able to convert your active rental into equity at any time toward any outfit
