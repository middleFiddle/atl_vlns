  <summary><strong>What if I just buy an inexpensive instrument?</strong></summary>

<summary>The Cost of Cheap Materials</summary>

- Cheaper instruments are more high maintenance. It is common in this case to spend more than their
  upfront costs within the first year.
- Often, the playability of these instruments is poor. The last thing a beginner needs is an instrument
  that is more difficult to play than it should be or that doesn't stay in tune.

<summary>The Cost of Routine Maintenance</summary>

- Keep in mind that routine maintenance will be necessary whether you own your
  instrument or not. Unless your rental doesn't get played at all, the annual costs
  of maintaining an instrument that you own, quickly exceed the annual maintenance
  cost of renting.

<summary>Playability and Adjustability</summary>

- Our instrument family (orchestral strings) requires care. Even with the best
  care, with regular use and exposure to varying temperatures and humidity it is expected
  that, over time, you may experience tuning pegs that stick or slip, a warped bridge,
  open seams, a fallen soundpost, etc. - When you rent with us, you are welcome to
  stop by anytime so we can make your playing experience easier and more enjoyable.
  We can help your instrument sound it's best.

  <strong>What happens if my instrument is damaged or stolen?</strong>
</summary>

- Insurance is not provided through the rental program. Liability is handled at our discretion on a case by case basis.
  We typically consider your history with us, the severity of the damage, and the extent to which the damage
  was due to carelessness or abuse.
- Our business thrives on long and happy relationships with our customers. You would never be liable
  for more than the wholesale replacement cost of your instrument and we will give you flexible options to
  settle the balance.
- In cases of theft or fire, you would not be liable for any damages with documentation.
