This program is very flexible.

- We can help you pick the right size for your instrument. When it's time to change sizes we make the process very easy.
- As a player's skills improve we provide options for high quality, handcarved, step-up rentals. This is a great program for students who really enjoy playing and advancing. It keeps maintenance costs low while building equity faster.
