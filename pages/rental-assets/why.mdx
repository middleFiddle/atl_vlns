<summary>The Cost of Cheap Materials</summary>

- Cheaper instruments are more high maintenance. It is common in this case to spend more than their
  upfront costs within the first year.
- Often, the playability of these instruments is poor. The last thing a beginner needs is an instrument
  that is more difficult to play than it should be or that doesn't stay in tune.

<summary>The Cost of Routine Maintenance</summary>

- Keep in mind that routine maintenance will be necessary whether you own your
  instrument or not. Unless your rental doesn't get played at all, the annual costs
  of maintaining an instrument that you own, quickly exceed the annual maintenance
  cost of renting.

<summary>Playability and Adjustability</summary>

- Our instrument family (orchestral strings) requires care. Even with the best
  care, with regular use and exposure to varying temperatures and humidity it is expected
  that, over time, you may experience tuning pegs that stick or slip, a warped bridge,
  open seams, a fallen soundpost, etc. - When you rent with us, you are welcome to
  stop by anytime so we can make your playing experience easier and more enjoyable.
  We can help your instrument sound it's best.

<summary>String Replacement and Rehairs </summary>

- Maintaining an instrument is like maintaining a car-
  the more you use it, the more often you will need a "tune-up"
- In this analogy, the strings and the hair of the bow are like your oil change or checking your brake pads.
- In general, bigger strings are replaced less often. Cellos and basses might change strings once every year or two while violinists tend to got through 2-3 sets a year.
- The fibers of the bow hair are responsible for creating tone. The hair degrades over time with use and likely needs to be change at least twice in year.

<summary>Set-up and Tuning Issues</summary>

- Stringed instruments have several
  crucial parts that most be hand-carved to fit each instrument:

  - the Pegs

  - the Bridge

  - the Soundpost

- These crucial parts are sensitive to weather changes
  and can easily shift if an instrument is bumped into. - If you don't see a
  teacher for private lessons, it can be tricky to tune especially as winter sets
  in and especially for cellos. You are always free to stop by for help. We
  sincerely want you to play and enjoy our instruments.

<summary>What happens if my instrument is damaged or stolen?</summary>

- Insurance is not provided through the rental program. Liability is handled at our discretion on a case by case basis.
  We typically consider your history with us, the severity of the damage, and the extent to which the damage
  was due to carelessness or abuse.
- Our business thrives on long and happy relationships with our customers. You would never be liable
  for more than the wholesale replacement cost of your instrument and we will give you flexible options to
  settle the balance.
- In cases of theft or fire, you would not be liable for any damages with documentation.
